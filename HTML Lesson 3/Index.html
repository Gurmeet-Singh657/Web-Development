  <p> <!-- paragraph tag gives a line break and add the paragraph-->
    <!-- For italicizing the text , we can use em and i tag
    em represents stress emphasis on something
    Just 'do' it already
    i represent the fictional , english letter
    The 'Queen Marry sailed' that night
    both give same results
    so best to use em

    <b> Hye everyone !! </b> <!-- It bolds the text-->
    <strong> Hye myself Gurmeet </strong> <!-- It also bolds the text-->
    <!-- preferred to use  strong tag for bolding since it gives strong importance-->
    <!-- while b emphasis on just styling -->
